This project is made to make improvement in National Education Policy.
In this project,we used Augmented Reality to make better understanding of the subjects.
The instruments which are used in physics,chemistry and biology lab can be viewed using AR.
We give contract to the people who can make better AR and we pay them.And implement them in our website.
Then we give subscription of this website to the schools for using,who doesn't have good instruments or can't afford those instruments.
